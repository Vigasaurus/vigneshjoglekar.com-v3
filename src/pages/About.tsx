					I am a 20-year-old Full-Stack Javascript Developer from Coppell,
					Texas. Iâ€™m enrolled in Texas A&M Bachelor of Science in Computer
					Science, Class of '22 with minors in Cybersecurity and Business. A web
					developer for 5 years, I strive to create user-friendly, responsive,
					and privacy-first websites and applications. After working with
					clients big and small, with robust teams as well as individually, I
					strive to ensure security, privacy, and usability for all products.
					<br />
					<br />
					Over the past 2 years, I've worked to further my technical experience,
					creating user-first websites and apps, but also by working closely as
					a technical liaison for a design and branding agency, handling
					responsibilities from basic web security to complex user privacy and
					access decisions while developing and directing the creation of a web
					and mobile application to streamline food-event Party Planning. I've
					also successfully led teams to accomplish both technical and
					interpersonal goals in my past experiences and as a Senior Resident
					Advisor.
					<br />
					<br />
					In my work with open-source organizations and codebases, I worked
					towards, and have been the maintainer of an online adaptation of the
					hit social-deduction board game, Secret Hitler, for the past 2 years.
					With over 70,000 monthly active users over the past 6 months, growing
					3% month-over-month, upwards of 1250 games played daily and nearly 1
					million games played over the past three and a half years, we find it
					absolutely vital to continually find new ways to best serve our
					end-users, with the help of our devoted team of contributors and
					moderators.
					<br />
					<br />
					After my experience working with members of larger organizations,
					namely Google and Mozilla, I find myself to greatly enjoy working to
					reach long-term goals and establishing procedures to get there
					efficiently. With a passion for creating, evolving and ultimately
					perfecting user-first products that serve a real purpose in the world,
					I hope to continue my journey in web and application development in
					the years and decades to come. I am as comfortable working in a large
					team, as I am leading one - with deeply rooted principles of quality,
					tenacity, and free and open learning.
